<h1><b>About The Project</b></h1>

<p><b>Where were you when you learned you would have to quarantine due to Cover-19? Did you immediately know where you would go? Imagine being in a foreign country, far from home and family, amidst a pandemic. What would you do? Go home? What if you can't go home?</b></p>

<p>It all started during Spring break. I decided to go to South Padre, in Texas, with a group of friends, we rented a cheap hotel. The holidays started pretty well when we got upgraded to a suite at our arrival. We would spend days on the beach, go eat in restaurants, live life worry-free, unaware of the storm roaring over our heads. I was eating frozen yogurt with my two friends, Apps and Pulkit, both international students like me. Apps lives in Dubai but has the Indian nationality because the Emirati nationality law is jus sanguinis. Although she has the Indian nationality, Apps would not consider India her home. It is, legally, her ‘country of origin’ but not what she perceives as home. She does not go there often and has no desire to. Pulkit is from Mumbai, in India, but he does everything he can to avoid going back to India during breaks. So, there we were, sitting at a round table, eating our frozen yogurt, filled with different fruity toppings, covered in chocolate sauce, when we got the email. I consciously use the pronoun ‘the’ here because this email was the one which would force us to make very difficult decisions.In this email sent by our University, we were told that due to the Covid-19 crisis the campus would not be opening for spring semester and the classes would be online from now on.<br><I>We strongly encourage all students to go back home after Spring Break and to not come back on campus.In-person classes should resume on the 15th of April. We will keep you informed through the evolution of the situation.</I><br>For most people, this was pretty straightforward. They knew where to go back to, they had a place in mind. Most thought about going back to the house they grew up in, the place they have been calling home for most of their lives. But, Apps, Pulkit and I, we weren’t sure where we were supposed to go back to. We were encouraged to go back home. The word Home holds many different meanings. The Merriam-Webster dictionary and the Oxford dictionary give many different meaning of this word, amongst which: one's place of residence, the social unit formed by a family living together, place of origin, an establishment providing residence and care for people with special needs, the type of family you come from, a house, apartment, etc. when it is considered as property that you can buy or sell,  your own country or your own area,… As indicated by the three last little dots, this is a non-exhaustive list. So, what meaning of home was supposed to be understood in this email? If by home our university intended us to understand ‘our place of origin’, it would prove pretty hard to go back there. Our countries had all been impacted pretty hard by the virus and were quarantining themselves. Trump issued travel bans on different countries. Belgium, my own home country, was on the black list, meaning that no plane was allowed to fly over there. There were some humanitarian flights, but those were only for the elderly and children and I did not belong to any of those groups. Honestly, none of us really thought about going back to our home country. It would have been foolish. The in-person classes were supposed to resume on the 15th of April. If we were to go back to our home countries, we had no way of knowing if we would be allowed back in the US later on. Turns out, we probably would not have been.</p>
<p>On this site, you will first encounter a very short documentary on the home page. It is a kind of amuse bouche to the full interviews available in the "Full Interview" section of this site. Each of these interviewees are international students studying at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska. All of them have seen their daily life turned upside down in the blink of an eye. Everyone was hit particularly hard by the Pandemic in different ways. The pandemic was a good reminder for all international students that we are not Americans. Trump wanted to send us home, reminding us clearly that we were only guests and that he had the power to take our visitation right away as he sees fit. International students studying in the US saw there lives turned upside down by this sanitary crisis. Some of them were living on campus and unable to go home because of travel bans and had to find a place to quarantine after learning that the campus was closing, others were able to go home but faced great difficulties when they tried to come back to finish their education, this is their stories.</p>
<p><b>I am in between. Trying to write to be understood by those who matter to me, yet also trying to push my mind with ideas beyond the everyday. It is another borderland I inhabit. Not quite here nor there. On good days I feel I am a bridge. On bad days I just feel alone.</b><br><b>― Sergio Troncoso, Crossing Borders: Personal Essays</b></p>

<h2><b>About The Documentary</b></h2>

<p>International students in the US have had it ruff during pandemic. I am myself an international student from Belgium studying at Creighton university, Nebraska, in the hope of getting my English Master soon. When my international friends and I heard about the campus closing down for quarantine we all had to make choices, do we stay or do we go? Those who initially decided to stay ended up being trapped in the US because of all the travel bans and those who decided to go where trapped in their own home country unable to come back to the US.<br>Quarantine has been hard on all of us and we all had to deal with many challenges like mental health issues, Trump threatening to deport us, academic issues, and so forth and so on. Technology was a huge help during this Pandemic as it allowed us to keep in touch with our family and friends at home as well as follow our classes online.<br>This semester, I took a class called "Rhetoric of Technology" for which I made this documentary.<br>Please excuse the low sound quality and the poor framing. This was only my second time creating something like this and I had to work with a very old video editing program because my Mac is pretty old and does not support adobe premiere nor any other program of the sort. This is a technological composition in which I use the interviews i filmed as well as fragments of the news and other videos found on Youtube. I also use certain soundtrack. You can find all my sources below.<br>I hope you enjoy watching this documentary !<br>Thank you :)</p>
